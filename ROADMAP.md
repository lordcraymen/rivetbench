# RivetBench Development Roadmap

This document outlines the next steps for implementing features and improvements to the RivetBench framework.

## Current Status

**Version**: 0.1.0 - MCP Implementation Complete  
**Date**: October 2025

### What's Working

âœ… **Core Framework**: Write-once endpoints with Zod schemas  
âœ… **REST Server**: Full REST API with Swagger UI at `/docs`  
âœ… **MCP Server**: Dual transport (stdio + TCP) MCP implementation  
âœ… **Schema Generation**: Automatic OpenAPI + MCP JSON Schema  
âœ… **Testing**: 27 unit tests passing  
âœ… **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with Node 20.x and 22.x  
âœ… **Quality**: Pre-commit hooks, linting, type checking

## Next: Version 0.2.0 - Testing & Quality

### 1. Cucumber Step Definitions (Priority: HIGH)
**Status**: ðŸ”´ Not Started  
**Branch**: `feature/implement-cucumber-steps`

BDD tests are defined but need step implementations:
- [ ] Implement step definitions for `echo.feature`
- [ ] Implement step definitions for `health.feature`
- [ ] Configure Cucumber execution in test suite
- [ ] Document BDD testing approach

### 2. Integration Tests (Priority: HIGH)
**Status**: ðŸ”´ Not Started  
**Branch**: `feature/integration-tests`

End-to-end testing with real servers:
- [ ] REST server integration tests with real HTTP requests
- [ ] MCP server integration tests with real protocol
- [ ] Cross-protocol consistency tests
- [ ] Add integration tests to CI pipeline

### 3. Error Handling & Logging (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Status**: ðŸ”´ Not Started  
**Branch**: `feature/error-handling-logging`

Production-grade error handling:
- [ ] Custom error classes (ValidationError, NotFoundError, etc.)
- [ ] Structured logging with Pino
- [ ] Error middleware for consistent responses
- [ ] Request ID tracking through pipeline

---

## Future: Version 0.3.0 - Production Ready

### Middleware System
**Status**: ðŸ”´ Not Started  
**Branch**: `feature/endpoint-middleware`

Pre/post processing for endpoints:
- [ ] Design middleware architecture
- [ ] Async middleware chain support
- [ ] Built-in middleware (auth, logging, rate limiting)
- [ ] Documentation and examples

### Performance & Monitoring
**Status**: ðŸ”´ Not Started  
**Branch**: `feature/production-readiness`

Production-ready features:
- [ ] Request/response compression
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] Metrics and monitoring (Prometheus)
- [ ] Enhanced health checks
- [ ] Graceful shutdown
- [ ] Docker support

---

## Future: Version 0.4.0+ - Extensions

### Developer Experience
**Status**: ðŸ’­ Planned

- [ ] CLI tool for scaffolding endpoints
- [ ] Hot reload for development
- [ ] VSCode snippets/extension
- [ ] Better error messages
- [ ] OpenAPI example generation

### Advanced Features
**Status**: ðŸ’­ Planned

- [ ] WebSocket support
- [ ] GraphQL endpoint generation
- [ ] Authentication/Authorization framework
- [ ] Database integration helpers
- [ ] File upload handling
- [ ] Streaming responses

### Documentation & Community
**Status**: ðŸ’­ Planned

- [ ] Architecture documentation with diagrams
- [ ] Tutorial series
- [ ] Example applications
- [ ] Video tutorials
- [ ] Community templates

## Implementation Principles

When implementing features, follow this process:

1. **Interface First**: Define the interface and types before implementation
2. **BDD Approach**: Write feature files to describe behavior
3. **Type Safety**: Ensure full TypeScript coverage
4. **Test Coverage**: Unit + integration tests for all features
5. **Documentation**: Update docs before merging
6. **CI Verification**: All checks must pass before merge

See `agent.md` for detailed workflow guidance.
