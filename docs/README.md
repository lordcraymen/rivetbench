## Maintenance Notes

**Kept Minimal**: This structure is designed to minimize context stuffing while maintaining precise guardrails. Each document has a specific purpose and consumption order.

**Agent-Friendly**: Documents follow a drill-down pattern - agents start with high-level policy (AGENTS.MD) and only dive deeper when needed for specific work.
