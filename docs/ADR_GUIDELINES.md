# ADR Guidelines for AI Assistants

This document provides guidelines for AI assistants when working with Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in this project.

## General Principles

### Deterministic Output
- Prefer deterministic CLI output when generating ADR artifacts
- Ensure consistent formatting and structure across ADR documents
- Use stable ordering for lists, tables, and generated content

### Network Independence
- Never assume network connectivity when generating ADR artifacts
- All ADR operations should work offline
- Don't fetch external resources during ADR generation or validation

### Documentation Standards
- Document manual steps in `docs/adr/README.md` when deviating from the default workflow
- Maintain consistency with existing ADR formatting and style
- Follow the established naming convention for new ADRs

## ADR-Specific Guidelines

### Status Management
- Use only the configured allowed statuses from `.adrx.config.json`
- Default allowed statuses: accepted, approved, proposed, draft, rejected, deprecated, superseded
- Validate status transitions according to project conventions

### Content Structure
- Ensure all required frontmatter fields are present: `title`, `status`, `summary`
- Keep summaries under 300 characters
- Follow the template structure in `docs/adr/templates/ADR-0000-template.md`

### File Management
- Use the naming convention: `ADR-XXXX-short-description.md`
- Place ADR files in the `docs/adr/` directory
- Update the ADR index when adding new ADRs
