# Branch Cleanup and Workflow Setup - Summary

**Date:** October 4, 2025

## Actions Completed

### 1. ✅ Deleted Merged Branches

Both local and remote branches that were already merged into main have been deleted:

- **feature/implement-cucumber-steps** (PR #8)
  - Local: ✓ Deleted
  - Remote: ✓ Deleted
  
- **refactor/cleanup-documentation** (PR #7)
  - Local: ✓ Deleted
  - Remote: ✓ Deleted

### 2. ✅ Automated Branch Cleanup Workflow

Created `.github/workflows/delete-merged-branches.yml`:

**Features:**
- Automatically deletes branches when PRs are merged
- Can be manually triggered to clean up all merged branches
- Uses GitHub's built-in authentication (no setup required)

**How it works:**
- Triggered on `pull_request: closed` events
- Checks if PR was merged (not just closed)
- Deletes the source branch automatically
- Can also be triggered manually from Actions tab to clean up multiple branches

### 3. ✅ Comprehensive Workflow Documentation

Created `WORKFLOW.md` with:
- Daily workflow best practices
- Branch naming conventions
- Step-by-step guide for starting fresh work
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Git aliases for power users
- Quick reference commands

### 4. ✅ Workflow Helper Script

Created `workflow.sh` - an executable helper script with commands:

```bash
# Start fresh work on a new branch
./workflow.sh fresh feature/your-feature-name

# Clean up local merged branches
./workflow.sh cleanup

# Show repository status
./workflow.sh status

# Show help
./workflow.sh help
```

### 5. ✅ Updated Documentation

Updated `README.md` to include:
- Link to new WORKFLOW.md
- Reference to BDD Testing Guide
- Better organization of documentation links

## Current Repository State

**Active Branches:**
- `main` only (clean state)

**All merged branches deleted:**
- No local feature branches remaining
- No remote feature branches remaining

## How to Use the New Workflow

### Starting New Work

```bash
# Using the helper script (recommended)
./workflow.sh fresh feature/new-feature

# Or manually
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
```

### After Your PR is Merged

The branch will be **automatically deleted** by GitHub Actions. On your local machine:

```bash
# Using the helper script
./workflow.sh cleanup

# Or manually
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git fetch --prune
```

### Checking Repository Status

```bash
# Using the helper script
./workflow.sh status

# Or manually
git branch --merged main        # See merged branches
git branch --no-merged main     # See unmerged branches
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Prevents accidental work on old branches** - Always start fresh from main
2. **Automatic cleanup** - No manual branch deletion needed after PR merge
3. **Clear documentation** - Everyone follows the same workflow
4. **Helper script** - Makes common operations easier
5. **Clean repository** - No clutter from old branches

## Next Steps for Contributors

1. Read `WORKFLOW.md` for detailed workflow instructions
2. Use `./workflow.sh fresh <branch-name>` to start new work
3. Create PRs as usual - branches will auto-delete after merge
4. Never reuse old feature branches

## Files Added/Modified

- `.github/workflows/delete-merged-branches.yml` (new)
- `WORKFLOW.md` (new)
- `workflow.sh` (new)
- `README.md` (updated)

All changes committed and pushed to main.
