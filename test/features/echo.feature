Feature: Echo endpoint
  In order to verify the basic RPC workflow
  As a client developer
  I want to receive the same message I send to the echo endpoint

  Scenario: Successful echo call
    Given the "echo" endpoint is registered with input { "message": "Hello" }
    When I call the endpoint
    Then I should receive a response containing { "echoed": "Hello" }

  Scenario: Validation failure for empty message
    Given the "echo" endpoint expects a non-empty "message"
    When I call the endpoint with { "message": "" }
    Then I should receive a validation error
