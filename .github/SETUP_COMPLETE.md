**Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Commit Type**: Infrastructure & DevOps Setup  
**Status**: âœ… Complete

---

## What Was Implemented

This commit establishes a professional development workflow with automated quality checks and CI/CD pipeline for RivetBench.

### 1. Pre-commit Hooks (Husky + lint-staged)
- âœ… Automatically runs linting with auto-fix on changed TypeScript files
- âœ… Runs TypeScript type checking before each commit
- âœ… Runs related tests for changed files
- âœ… Prevents commits that fail quality checks

**Files added/modified:**
- `.husky/pre-commit` - Pre-commit hook script
- `package.json` - Added husky, lint-staged, and new npm scripts

**New npm scripts:**
- `npm run type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm run lint:fix` - Run linter with auto-fix
- `npm run test:ci` - Run tests once (for CI, no watch mode)
- `npm run prepare` - Initialize Husky (runs on npm install)

### 2. GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline
- âœ… Runs on all pushes to `main` and all pull requests
- âœ… Tests against Node.js 20.x and 22.x (matrix strategy)
- âœ… Runs linting, type checking, unit tests, and BDD tests
- âœ… Build verification step
- âœ… BDD tests currently allowed to fail (until step definitions are implemented)

**Files added:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Complete CI pipeline configuration

**Pipeline stages:**
1. **Test & Lint** (parallel for Node 20.x and 22.x)
   - Checkout code
   - Setup Node.js with npm cache
   - Install dependencies
   - Run ESLint
   - Run TypeScript type checking
   - Run Vitest tests
   - Run Cucumber BDD tests (allowed to fail temporarily)

2. **Build** (runs after tests pass)
   - Verify TypeScript compilation

### 3. Branch Protection Documentation
- âœ… Comprehensive guide for setting up GitHub branch protection
- âœ… Enforces PR workflow with CI checks
- âœ… Branch naming conventions documented

**Files added:**
- `.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md` - Step-by-step setup guide

**Recommended settings:**
- Require PR approvals (minimum 1)
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require conversation resolution
- Optional: require signed commits

### 4. Pull Request Template
- âœ… Structured template for all PRs
- âœ… Includes checklists for code quality, testing, and documentation
- âœ… Links to related issues
- âœ… Forces contributors to think about their changes

**Files added:**
- `.github/pull_request_template.md`

### 5. Contributing Guidelines
- âœ… Complete development workflow documentation
- âœ… Branch naming conventions
- âœ… Commit message guidelines (Conventional Commits)
- âœ… Code style guidelines
- âœ… Testing instructions
- âœ… PR process explained

**Files added/updated:**
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Comprehensive contribution guide (updated existing file)

### 6. CODEOWNERS
- âœ… Automatic reviewer assignment for PRs
- âœ… Ownership defined for different parts of the codebase

**Files added:**
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` - Owner: @lordcraymen for all code

### 7. Development Roadmap
- âœ… Detailed next steps for implementing missing features
- âœ… Prioritized task list with explanations
- âœ… Implementation strategy and phases
- âœ… Success criteria for each feature

**Files added/updated:**
- `ROADMAP.md` - Comprehensive development roadmap (updated existing file)

### 8. Cucumber Configuration
- âœ… Proper configuration for Cucumber/BDD tests
- âœ… Uses `tsx` for TypeScript support
- âœ… Outputs HTML report to `test-results/`

**Files added:**
- `cucumber.config.js` - Cucumber configuration

### 9. Bug Fixes
- âœ… Fixed ESLint warning in `src/core/endpoint.ts` (unused type parameter)
- âœ… Added `test-results/` to `.gitignore`

## How to Use

### For Development
```bash
# Work on a feature (hooks will run on commit)
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
# Make changes...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add my feature"  # Pre-commit checks run automatically
git push origin feature/my-feature

# Create PR on GitHub
# Wait for CI to pass
# Get code review
# Merge when approved
```

### Before Merging This Commit
After this commit is pushed to `main`, **immediately** set up branch protection:

1. Go to GitHub repository settings
2. Navigate to: Settings â†’ Branches â†’ Branch protection rules
3. Follow the instructions in `.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md`
4. **This is the last direct commit to main!**

### After Branch Protection is Set Up
- âœ… All changes must go through Pull Requests
- âœ… All PRs must pass CI before merging
- âœ… All PRs must be reviewed and approved
- âœ… Direct commits to `main` will be blocked

---

## Next Steps (In Priority Order)

See `ROADMAP.md` for full details. Summary:

### Critical (Must do next):
1. **Implement echo endpoint** (`feature/implement-echo-endpoint`)
2. **Add Cucumber step definitions** (`feature/implement-cucumber-steps`)
3. **Zod-to-OpenAPI conversion** (`feature/zod-to-openapi-conversion`)
4. **MCP server implementation** (`feature/implement-mcp-server`)

### Important (Should do soon):
5. **Swagger UI integration** (`feature/add-swagger-ui`)
6. **Error handling & logging** (`feature/error-handling-logging`)
7. **Integration tests** (`feature/integration-tests`)

### Nice to have:
8. Middleware system
9. Production readiness features
10. Developer experience improvements
11. Advanced features
12. Documentation enhancements

## Testing This Setup

### Test Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Make a small change
echo "// test" >> src/config/index.ts

# Try to commit (hooks will run)
git add src/config/index.ts
git commit -m "test: testing pre-commit hooks"

# Should see:
# - lint-staged running
# - ESLint checking
# - Type checking
# - Related tests running
```

### Test CI Pipeline
```bash
# Push to a branch
git checkout -b test/ci-pipeline
git push origin test/ci-pipeline

# Create PR on GitHub
# Watch the Actions tab for CI runs
```

---

## Dependencies Added

```json

2. **Set up branch protection immediately** after merging this commit
3. **BDD tests will fail** until step definitions are implemented (this is expected)
4. **TypeScript version warning** - Can be ignored or update @typescript-eslint packages
5. **Husky installation** - Runs automatically via `prepare` script when others `npm install`
