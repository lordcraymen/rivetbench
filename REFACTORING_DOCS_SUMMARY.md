## What Was Done

### ‚úÖ Created Streamlined Agent Policy

**New File**: `AGENTS.MD` (root)
- Concise policy based on your example format
- Priorities: P0 Correctness > P1 Security > P2 Maintainability > P3 Performance > P4 Speed
- Definition of Done (5 rules)
- SOLID & Clean Code enforced subset (8 rules)
- Style, Tests, Security, Logging guidelines
- Output contract for agents
- Drill-down references to detailed docs
- Quick reference patterns
- Pre-commit checklist
- Context hierarchy (Level 1-3)

### ‚úÖ Consolidated Architecture Documentation

**New File**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Merged content from:
  - `docs/SOLID_PRINCIPLES.md` (deleted)
  - `docs/SOLID_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` (deleted)
  - `docs/ERROR_HANDLING.md` (deleted)
  - `docs/REFACTORING_DEPENDENCY_INJECTION.md` (moved to history)
- Sections:
  1. SOLID Principles (with code examples)
  2. Dependency Injection Pattern (before/after)
  3. Error Handling (error classes, usage)
  4. Logging (structured logging, MCP-specific)
  5. Transport Parity (REST/MCP consistency)

### ‚úÖ Consolidated Testing Documentation

**New File**: `docs/TESTING.md`
- Merged content from:
  - `docs/BDD_TESTING.md` (deleted)
  - `docs/SELF_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md` (content distributed)
- Sections:
  1. Test Structure
  2. Unit Tests (Vitest) with patterns
  3. BDD Tests (Cucumber) workflow
  4. Test Commands
  5. Best Practices
  6. Debugging

### ‚úÖ Streamlined Contributing Guide

**Updated**: `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Removed redundant content
- Added clear section structure
- References to detailed docs (AGENTS.MD, ARCHITECTURE.md, TESTING.md)
- Emphasis on SOLID principles and DI
- Simplified workflow sections

### ‚úÖ Organized Documentation Structure

**Root Directory** (only project essentials):

## Consumption Order Pattern

### Level 1: Quick Policy (Always)
**File**: `AGENTS.MD`
- Read first for every task
- Contains essential rules and priorities
- Quick reference patterns
- Drill-down pointers to Level 2

### Level 2: Detailed Guides (On Demand)
**Files**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/TESTING.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Read specific sections when needed
- Comprehensive but focused
- Contains examples and patterns

### Level 3: Specialized Docs (Task-Specific)
**Files**: `docs/MCP_GUIDE.md`
- Only for specialized work (e.g., MCP features)
- Not loaded unless explicitly needed

### Reference: Project Overview
**File**: `README.md`
- User-facing documentation
- Project description and quick start

---

## Benefits Achieved

### üéØ Reduced Context Stuffing
- **Before**: 10 documentation files (~2,800 lines)
- **After**: 4 active docs + 1 policy (~1,500 lines core content)
- **Savings**: ~45% reduction in documentation volume

### üìä Clear Hierarchy
- Agents know exactly what to read first (AGENTS.MD)
- Drill-down structure prevents over-consumption
- Specialized docs only loaded when needed

### üîç Precise Guardrails
- All critical rules preserved
- Examples and patterns maintained
- Self-check mechanisms intact
- DoD and policy enforced

### üöÄ Improved Developer Experience
- Clear entry point (AGENTS.MD)
- Easy navigation (docs/README.md index)
- Less overwhelming for new contributors
- Historical context preserved but separate

### ü§ñ Agent-Friendly
- Consumption order matches agent workflow
- Quick reference patterns for common tasks
- Self-check contract with clear IDs
- Minimal but sufficient guardrails

---

## How Agents Should Use This

### Starting Any Task
1. Read `AGENTS.MD` (always)
2. Note priorities, DoD, SOLID rules
3. Use quick reference patterns
4. Check drill-down references if needed

### During Implementation
- Reference `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for patterns
- Reference `docs/TESTING.md` for test patterns
- Check `CONTRIBUTING.md` for workflow

### Before Creating PR
- Complete self-check from `AGENTS.MD`
- Verify DoD items [DOD-01] through [DOD-05]
- Verify SOLID items [SOLID-SRP-01], [SOLID-DIP-02], [SOLID-DIP-03]
- Return output contract (PLAN, CHANGES, SELF-CHECK)

## Comparison with Your Example

Your policy had:
```
Priorities, DoD (5), SOLID subset (6), Style (3), Tests (2), Security (3)
Total: ~50 lines of core policy
Drill-down: References to detailed docs
```

Our policy has:
```
Priorities, DoD (5), SOLID subset (8), Style (3), Tests (3), Security (3), Logging (3)
Total: ~80 lines of core policy + quick reference
Drill-down: References to ARCHITECTURE.md, TESTING.md, CONTRIBUTING.md
```

**Similar approach**:
- ‚úÖ Consumption order (Level 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3)
- ‚úÖ Precise but minimal policy
- ‚úÖ Rule IDs for self-check
- ‚úÖ Drill-down references
- ‚úÖ Output contract
- ‚úÖ Quick reference patterns

**Adapted for RivetBench**:
- Added MCP-specific logging rules (critical for this project)
- Emphasis on dependency injection (recent refactoring)
- TypeScript-specific guidelines
- BDD testing workflow

---

## Validation

### File Count
- **Root MD files**: 2 (README.md, AGENTS.MD) ‚úÖ
- **Contributing**: 1 (CONTRIBUTING.md) ‚úÖ
- **Docs (active)**: 4 (ARCHITECTURE.md, TESTING.md, MCP_GUIDE.md, README.md) ‚úÖ
- **Docs (historical)**: 3 (REFACTORING_HISTORY.md, WORKFLOW_HISTORY.md, ROADMAP.md) ‚úÖ

### Structure
- ‚úÖ Clear hierarchy (Level 1-2-3)
- ‚úÖ Minimal root directory
- ‚úÖ Consolidated docs in docs/
- ‚úÖ Historical context preserved
- ‚úÖ Navigation index (docs/README.md)

### Content
- ‚úÖ All guardrails preserved
- ‚úÖ SOLID principles documented
- ‚úÖ DI pattern documented
- ‚úÖ Testing patterns documented
- ‚úÖ MCP-specific rules included
- ‚úÖ Self-check mechanism maintained

---

## Next Steps

### For Developers
1. Start every task by reading `AGENTS.MD`
2. Use drill-down references when needed
3. Complete self-check before PRs

### For Agents
1. Load `AGENTS.MD` by default
2. Drill down to Level 2 docs only when specific details needed
3. Load Level 3 (MCP_GUIDE.md) only for MCP-specific work
4. Return output contract: PLAN, CHANGES, SELF-CHECK

### Future Maintenance
- Keep `AGENTS.MD` minimal (<100 lines policy)
- Add new rules with IDs for trackability
- Update drill-down references as needed
- Archive old content to docs/*_HISTORY.md files
