# Documentation Cleanup and Consolidation

## Summary

This PR consolidates the project's documentation by merging multiple overlapping MCP implementation documents into a single comprehensive guide, removing temporary files, and establishing a clean `docs/` directory structure for future technical documentation.

## Changes

### üìÅ New Structure

**Created**:
- `docs/` directory for technical guides
- `docs/MCP_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive MCP implementation guide (~650 lines)

### ‚úÖ Files Consolidated

Merged 3 MCP documentation files into single comprehensive guide:
- ‚ùå `MCP.md` (265 lines)
- ‚ùå `MCP_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (195 lines)  
- ‚ùå `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` (255 lines)
- ‚úÖ `docs/MCP_GUIDE.md` (650 lines) ‚Üê **New consolidated guide**

### üóëÔ∏è Files Removed

**Temporary/Tracking Files**:
- ‚ùå `cleanup.md` - Temporary tracking log
- ‚ùå `test/steps/README.md` - Placeholder file

**PR-Specific Files**:
- ‚ùå `PR_DESCRIPTION.md` - Specific to merged PR
- ‚ùå `PR_CREATION_GUIDE.md` - No longer needed

### üìù Files Updated

**ROADMAP.md**:
- Reorganized with version-based structure (v0.1.0, v0.2.0, etc.)
- Moved completed items to "Version History" section
- Focused on future features with clear status indicators
- Improved readability and maintainability

**README.md**:
- Added "Documentation" section with links to guides
- Updated to reference new `docs/MCP_GUIDE.md`

### ‚úÖ Files Kept

- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contributor guidelines
- `ROADMAP.md` - Development roadmap (updated)
- `agent.md` - AI workflow guide (kept for consistency)
- All `.github/` documentation

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Single Source of Truth**: One comprehensive MCP guide instead of 3 overlapping files  
‚úÖ **Cleaner Structure**: 45% fewer root-level markdown files  
‚úÖ **Better Organization**: Technical guides properly organized in `docs/`  
‚úÖ **Improved Maintainability**: Less duplication, easier to update  
‚úÖ **Scalable**: Clear structure for adding future documentation  
‚úÖ **Professional**: Clean organization for open source project  

## docs/MCP_GUIDE.md Features

The new consolidated guide includes:
- Complete table of contents
- Overview and key features
- Quick start for both transports (stdio + TCP)
- Configuration reference
- Architecture diagrams
- Step-by-step endpoint creation guide
- Comprehensive testing instructions
- Integration guides (Claude Desktop, MCP Inspector)
- Troubleshooting section
- Best practices
- Complete API reference
- External references and links

## File Count

**Before**: 11 markdown files in root directory  
**After**: 5 markdown files in root + organized `docs/` directory  
**Reduction**: 45% fewer root-level files

## Testing

‚úÖ All tests pass: **27/27**  
‚úÖ Type checking: **Clean**  
‚úÖ No linting errors  
‚úÖ No broken references  

## Migration Path

All content has been consolidated:
- Users looking for MCP info should now use `docs/MCP_GUIDE.md`
- README.md links updated to point to new location
- No functionality changes - purely documentation organization

## Checklist

- [x] All markdown files reviewed and analyzed
- [x] Temporary and outdated files removed
- [x] MCP documentation consolidated into comprehensive guide
- [x] ROADMAP.md restructured for future focus
- [x] README.md updated with new references
- [x] agent.md kept for workflow consistency
- [x] All tests passing (27/27)
- [x] Type checking clean
- [x] No broken documentation links
- [x] Commit follows conventional commits format

## What's Next

This cleanup establishes a foundation for future documentation:
- Additional guides can be added to `docs/` (ARCHITECTURE.md, API.md, etc.)
- Clear separation between user docs (root) and technical guides (docs/)
- Easier maintenance and updates
